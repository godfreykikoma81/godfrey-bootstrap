        <h3>What is Bootstrap</h3>
        <p>
            Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites
            and web applications. It provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript tools, including pre-designed
            components such as buttons, navigation bars, forms, modals, and grids, which help developers create
            consistent and visually appealing user interfaces quickly and efficiently. Developed by Twitter, Bootstrap
            simplifies the design process by offering a robust and flexible grid system, responsive design utilities,
            and customizable styles that can be easily tailored to match the branding of a project. Its wide adoption
            and comprehensive documentation make it a go-to choice for both beginners and experienced developers.
